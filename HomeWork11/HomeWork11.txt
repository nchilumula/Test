1.Bootstrap Grid System
  Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.

  If you do not want to use all 12 column individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns.

  Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in three columns, but on a small screen it would be better if the content items were stacked on top of each other.

  Example:
  <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
  </div>
  </div>

2.The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:
  xs (for phones)
  sm (for tablets)
  md (for desktops)
  lg (for larger desktops)
  
  The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.

3.There are lots of bootstrap components like buttons, 
  icons, form input types, navigation menu, and many.

  Bootstrap panels:
  A panel in bootstrap is a bordered box with some padding around its content.
  Panels are created with the .panel class, and content inside the panel has a .panel-body class.

  Bootstrap Buttons:
  Bootstrap includes six predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose.

  Bootstrap Input
  Bootstrap supports all the HTML5 input types: text, password, datetime, datetime-local, date, month, time, week, number, email, url, search, tel, and color.
