3.Pre-processing:
  We develop a Sass stylesheet from which CSS is generated.

  Variables:
  Sass enables us to write variables like any other programming language.

  Nesting:
  Styling elements inside an element using nested hierarchy. Instead of using space, >, ^ symbols to style the elements inside an element.

  Partials:
  Partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that can be included in other files.

  Import:
  Sass lets us to import multiple .scss files into another .scss file.

  Mixins:
  Similar to a method or a function.

  Inheritance:
  Sass helps keep the code DRY(don`t repeat yourself).

  Operators:
  Simple math operations can be done in Sass.
