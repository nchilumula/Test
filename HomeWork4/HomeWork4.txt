5.The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing 
  in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.
  The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
  There are three different <!DOCTYPE> declarations in HTML 4.01. In HTML5 there is only one:<!DOCTYPE html>
