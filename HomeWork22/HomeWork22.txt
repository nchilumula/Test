3.AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:
  Update a web page without reloading the page
  Request & Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
  Send data to a server - in the background

  AJAX is not a programming language.
  AJAX is a technique for accesing web servers from a web page.
  AJAX stands for Asyncronous JavaScript And XML.

4.With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it 
  needs to create dynamic HTML: 
	JavaScript can add/remove/change all the HTML elements & attributes in the page
	JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
	JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page

5.The flow of capturing and bubbling is called event 
  propagation


6.The event.stopPropagation() method stops the bubbling 
  of an event to parent elements, preventing any parent event handlers from being executed.

7.Bubbling:
  After an event triggers on the deepest possible element, it then triggers on parents in nesting order.
Capturing:
  The event first goes down - thatâ€™s called capturing, 
  and then bubbles up. This behavior is standartized in W3C specification.

  According to this model, the event:
  Captures down - through 1 -> 2 -> 3.
  Bubbles up - through 3 -> 2 -> 1.
