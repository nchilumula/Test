Angular JS can be added to a html page using
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script>

It is a javascript framework.

AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives:
	The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

	The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

	The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view. 

Example:
<div ng-app=""> //ng-app defines <div> is owner of an angular js application
  <p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p> //ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name
  <p ng-bind="name"></p> //ng-bind directive binds the innerHTML of the <p> element to the application variable name
</div>

The ng-init directive initializes AngularJS application variables.

AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}

-->AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.
-->AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications. 
-->The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller

Example: index0.html
----------------------------------------------------------
Custom Directives:
-->We can use the module to add own directives to applications
-->You can invoke a directive by using:
	Element name   <test-directive></test-directive>
	Attribute	   <div test-directive></div>
	Class          <div class="test-directive"</div>
	Comment		   <!-- directive: test-directive -->

By adding a restrict property with the value "A", the directive can only be invoked by attributes.E for Element name,C for Class,M for Comment

Example: index1.html
----------------------------------------------------------
ng-repeat:
The ng-repeat directive repeats an HTML element.
It is used on array of objects.

Example:index2.html
----------------------------------------------------------
Filters:
Filters can be added to expressions by using the pipe character |, followed by a filter.

currency: Format a number to a currency format.
date: Format a date to a specified format.
filter: Select a subset of items from an array.
json: Format an object to a JSON string.
limitTo: Limits an array/string, into a specified number of elements/characters.
lowercase: Format a string to lower case.
number: Format a number to a string.
orderBy: Orders an array by an expression.
uppercase: Format a string to upper case.

Example: index3.html
----------------------------------------------------------
Service:
In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.

-->We can use the $http service to request data from the server.
-->The $timeout service is AngularJS' version of the window.setTimeout function.

There are about 30 built in services in Angular JS

We can also create a new service.

Example: index4.html
