1.The :first-child selector is used to select the 
  specified selector, only if it is the first child of its parent.

  The :first-of-type selector matches every element that is the first child, of a particular type, of its parent.

  The :nth-child(n) selector matches every element that is the nth child, regardless of type, of its parent.
  n can be a number, a keyword, or a formula.

  The :nth-of-type(n) selector matches every element that is the nth child, of a particular type, of its parent.

3.Box Model
  All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

  The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

  Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
  Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
  Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
  Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

  The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

  Example: box.html

4.The position property specifies the type of positioning 
  method used for an element.

  There are four different position values:
  static
  relative
  fixed
  absolute

  Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

  Example: position.html
